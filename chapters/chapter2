- pg 54-59 - look out for var - that it can only be used as a local variable type inference
- 64 - System.gc() is not guarenteed to run or do anything, and you should be able to recognize when objects become eligible for garbage collection (when the object's state no longer being accessible in a program and therefor able to be garbage collected)
    - An object is no longer reachable when either:
        1. The object no longer has any references pointing to it
        2. All references to the object have gone out of scope
- finalize() can run zero or one times. It cannot run twice
- Be able to recognize the constructor 
    - has same namea s class
    - looks like a method without a return type
- Local variables require explicit instantialization - others use the default value for that type
